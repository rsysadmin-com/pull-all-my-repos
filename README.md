# pull-all-my-repos
Bash script to automatically pull all your Git repositories

## usage
Before you can use this script, please set the variable `repos_base` and make it point to the directory where all your Git repositories is located.

Once you've done that, simply execute the script.

## requirements
This script obviously needs git to be installed on your system.

If it is not in your $PATH, it will bail out with an error message.


## disclaimer
This script was created out of lazynes so I did not need to execute "git pull" on every directory where I have a repo.

It is provided on a n "AS IS" basis. The author is not to be held responsible for the use or misuse thereof.
